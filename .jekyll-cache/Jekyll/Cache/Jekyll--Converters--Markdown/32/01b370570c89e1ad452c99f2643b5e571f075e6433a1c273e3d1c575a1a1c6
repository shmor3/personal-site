ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Iâ€™m Joel Glovier. Iâ€™m a human being human.
I design and build software for humans. I phrase it that way because itâ€™s easy to forget that everyone is human. We often tend to think first in foremost of people in terms of what they do (their job role or profession), or their status as something in our society or culture, or in relationship to us. But everyone is first and foremost, a person.

The software Iâ€™ve worked on for most of my career is developer tooling. I recently realized that was my ancestral destiny, but thatâ€™s another story (Glovier =&gt; Glover =&gt; Glove-maker =&gt; Glovers were making tools for other craftspeople ages ago).
